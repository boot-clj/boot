       so-called sync map, shared data among threads of execution, at various
       phases of the parallel computation.

All the functions will receive a mutable java.util.HashMap in input that will
be passed down in boot.pod/data. The values will be probably modified so be
sure that they are either thread safe or immutable.

No Clojure should be put in here, not even HashMap keys. The functions should
return THE SAME object in output. This is a necessary devil to face for correct
concurrent execution and it is due to the fact that Clojure data structures
cannot be passed around in pods.

There are six hooks, below are the keys, the default is identity:

 :batch-init    ;; called before running a batch in parallel
 :task-init     ;; called before running a task}"}
