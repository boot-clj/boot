  Pool Service API:
  -----------------

  The pod-pool function returns a pod service instance, which is itself a
  Clojure function. The pod service function can be called with no arguments
  or with :refresh or :shutdown.

  Calling the function with no arguments produces a reference to the current
  pod. Expressions can be evaluated in this pod via with-eval-in, etc.
  
  Calling the function with the :refresh argument swaps out the current pod,
  destroys it, and promotes a pod from the reserve pool. A new pod is created
  asynchronously to replenish the reserve pool.

  Calling the function with the :shutdown argument destroys all pods in the
  pool and shuts down the service.

  Options:
  --------

  :size       The total number of pods to be maintained in the pool. Default
              size is 2.
  :init       A function that is called when a new pod is created. Takes the
              new pod as an argument, is evaluated for side effects only.
  :destroy    A function that is called when a pod is destroyed. Takes the pod
              to be destroyed as an argument, is evaluated for side effects
              before pod is destroyed."
