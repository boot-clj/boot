(defn write-exception
  "Writes a formatted version of the exception to the [[StringWriter]]. By default, writes to *out* and includes
  the stack trace, with no frame limit.

  The options map may have the following keys:

  :filter
  : The stack frame filter, which defaults to [[*default-stack-frame-filter*]].

  :properties
  : If true (the default) then properties of exceptions will be output.

  :frame-limit
  : If non-nil, the number of stack frames to keep when outputing the stack trace
    of the deepest exception.

  Output may be traditional or modern, as controlled by [[*traditional*]].
  Traditional is the typical output order for Java: the stack of exceptions comes first (outermost to
  innermost) followed by the stack trace of the innermost exception, with the frames
  in deepest to shallowest order.

  Modern output is more readable; the stack trace comes first and is reversed: shallowest frame to deepest.
  Then the exception stack is output, from the root exception to the outermost exception.
  The modern output order is more readable, as it puts the most useful information together at the bottom, so that
  it is not necessary to scroll back to see, for example, where the exception occured.

  The default is modern.

  The stack frame filter is passed the map detailing each stack frame
  in the stack trace, must return one of the following values:

  :show
  : is the normal state; display the stack frame.

  :hide
  : prevents the frame from being displayed, as if it never existed.

  :omit
  : replaces the frame with a \"...\" placeholder; multiple consecutive :omits will be collapsed to a single line.
    Use :omit for \"uninteresting\" stack frames.

  :terminate
  : hides the frame AND all later frames.

  The default filter is [[*default-frame-filter*]].  An explicit filter of nil will display all stack frames.

  Repeating lines are collapsed to a single line, with a repeat count. Typically, this is the result of
  an endless loop that terminates with a StackOverflowException.

  When set, the frame limit is the number of stack frames to display; if non-nil, then some of the outermost
  stack frames may be omitted. It may be set to 0 to omit the stack trace entirely (but still display
  the exception stack).  The frame limit is applied after the frame filter (which may hide or omit frames) and
  after repeating stack frames have been identified and coallesced ... :frame-limit is really the number
  of _output_ lines to present.

  Properties of exceptions will be output using Clojure's pretty-printer, honoring all of the normal vars used
  to configure pretty-printing; however, if `*print-length*` is left as its default (nil), the print length will be set to 10.
  This is to ensure that infinite lists do not cause endless output or other exceptions.

  The `*fonts*` var contains ANSI definitions for how fonts are displayed; bind it to nil to remove ANSI formatting entirely."

(defn parse-exception
  "Given a chunk of text for an exception report (as with `.printStackTrace`), attempts to
  piece together the same information provided by [[analyze-exception]].  The result
  is ready to pass to [[write-exception*]].

  This code does not attempt to recreate properties associated with the exceptions; in most
  exception's cases, this is not necessarily written to the output. For clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo,
  it is hard to distinguish the message text from the printed exception map.

  The options are used when processing the stack trace and may include the :filter and :frame-limit keys.

  Returns a sequence of exception maps; the final map will include the :stack-trace key (a vector
  of stack trace element maps).  The exception maps are ordered outermost to innermost (that final map
  is the root exception).

  This should be considered experimental code; there are many cases where it may not work properly.

  It will work quite poorly with exceptions whose message incorporates a nested exception's
  .printStackTrace output. This happens too often with JDBC exceptions, for example."
